# CS100-Checkers

This is a repository to help me synchronize changes that I make to the CS 100 Checkers project.
The **Info on Use** section only applies to a version of this project that has all the 
class files and documentation in a `playcheckers.jar` file. Most of the topics below can
apply to this version, but the classpath specified at the terminal and as well in the 
.classpath file are different.

# Info on Use

Below is some information on how the checkers program is intended to run.
Words surrounded with * are meant to be relative to person using, and not the actual text.

## Program Locations

### Running Tournament

`checkers.Tournament`

### Running Student Play

`checkers.Play`

## Using Eclipse

Assuming the files are unzipped, to load the project to Eclipse:
1. Open Eclipse, and click on the 'File' option at the top left
2. Click the 'Open Projects from File System...' option near the top
3. Near the top right of the dialog box, click the 'Directory' option
4. Navigate to the folder location where the unzipped files are
5. Click 'Finish' at the bottom right of the window

### Compiling

The classpath file should be set up to already have all the libraries and documentation included,
so compiling should be automatically set up when opening the project in Eclipse

### Running

#### To run, a new run configuration must be added

1. At the top, click the small down arrow to the right of the green run button
2. Near the top left, click the 'New launch configuration'
3. In the 'Main' tab, enter in one of the Program Locations in the 'Main class' text box
4. In the 'Arguments' tab, enter in the program arguments in the 'Program arguments' tab
    * The exact arguements are specified in the programs, or can be shown by adding the `-h` argument
    * These arguments can be changed any time afterwards by just going through the same steps as before
    * Some of the program arguements are optional while there are also some that are required to run
5. Click either 'Run' or 'Apply' and 'Close'
6. Now to run, the green run button can just be used

## Using the Terminal

1. After unzipping the files to a location, change the directory to that unzipped location
2. Enter to commands below to compile/run

### Compile Command

`javac -d bin -cp "src:lib/playcheckers.jar" src/submissions/*YourEval*.java`

### Run Command

`java -cp "bin:lib/playcheckers.jar" *Program Location* *program args*`

### On Windows

Replace the colon characters `:` with semicolons `;`  e.g.

`java -cp "bin;lib/playcheckers.jar" *Program Location* *program args*`
